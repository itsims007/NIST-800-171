System Security Plan

In this project We're going to take a look at
requirements a family 3.13 system and communications protection. We'll build some of our body
of evidence for that family. We'll look at a policy, we'll build the system security plan for
this particular requirements family and we'll build a plan of action milestones
for this requirements family. Will also then take a look at basic assessment for this requirements family
including some scoring. And we'll take a look at the SPRS, the supplier performance risk system.
